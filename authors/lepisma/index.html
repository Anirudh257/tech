    "title": "Seminar - Code Mixing in NLP and Speech",
    "body": "2021/08/24 - Below are some pointers and insights from the papers that we covered in the recently concluded seminar on code-mixing in NLP and Speech. During the seminar we covered 6 papers, two each from NLP, Speech Synthesis and Speech Recognition. Session-1 (NLP) Paper : GLUECoS : An Evaluation Benchmark for Code-Switched NLPPresenter : Shashank Shailabh The main idea of GLUECoS is to introduce a benchmark evaluation task set for code-switched NLP. It is inspired from GLUE (Generalized Language Evaluation Benchmark) and covers tasks such as Language Identification (LID), Part-Of-Speech (POS) Tagging, Named Entity Recognition (NER), Question &amp; Answering (QA), Natural Language Inference (NLI) and sentiment analysis (SENT).  and also introduces benchmark code-mixed datasets. The language pairs that this benchmark covers in English-Spanish and English-Hindi code-mixed datasets. The paper also introduces several Metrics, most of which are covered in the previous blog on Metrics for Code-switching. To arrive at a baseline performance, several cross-lingual word embeddings models such as MUSE (supervised and unsupervised embeddings), BiCVM, Biskip and GCM embeddings are used. For supervised cross-lingual embeddings one requires a parallel mono-lingual corpus of the two languages such that each sentence in one language maps as close as possible to the parallel sentence in the other language. In the unsupervised setting an adversarial loss is used to train cross-lingual embeddings. The other model that is used for the baseline is multilingual models (mBERT). This model is simply trained on monolingual data from each language, and has no explicit loss to map the embedding of the same words from both languages to the same point. Another fine-tuned version of mBert is used which is fine-tuned on synthetically generated code-switched data. Interestingly the mBert model performs better as compared the cross-lingual embeddings and fine-tuning on synthetic data further improves performance. Session-2 (Speech Synthesis)Paper : Building Multilingual End-to-End Speech Synthesisers for Indian LanguagesPresenter : Swaraj The goal of the paper is to build a Multilingual TTS for Indic languages in a low data resource setting. The paper discusses ways of assimilating inputs from different indian scripts both at the level of characters and phonemes, into a common input set. This leverages the similarities in phonemes and the structure of Indian languages which fall in the Abjad class of languages where vowels are diacritics.  For phonemes, it looks at 2 approaches : a transliteration approach using the unified parser and the common label set; and another approach that considers a 1:1 phoneme map between the different languages. At character level they present the MLCM character set that is 68 characters in total and combines 8 indic scripts. Since vowels are a major component in indic languages, they consider approaches where the vowel and vowel modifier are mapped to the same and different input token. For modelling they use tacotron-2 and compare the impact of various input tokens on performance for monolingual and multilingual settings. The primary take away from the discussion were the different ways of combining and varying the input representations for training an Indic language TTS. Session - 3 (NLP)Paper : BERTologiCoMix, How does Code-Mixing interact with Multilingual BERT? Presenter : Jaivarsan B This paper addresses the impact (on code-mixed tasks) of fine-tuning with different types of code-mixed data and outlines the changes to mBERT’s attention heads during such fine-tuning. Code-mixing can be treated as a domain adaptation problem, but in this particular context it is to adapt at the grammatical level, not purely at the vocabulary level or style level. For sake of empirical study they evaluate two different language pairs, english-spanish (enes), english-hindi (enhi) with the extra three different varieties on them. Those three varieties are namely: randomly-ordered CM (l-CM), grammatically appropriate CM (g-cm) and real-world CM (r-CM), so in total we have 2 lang pairs * 3 varieties = 6 possible fine-tuning datasets on mBERT against the plain mBERT. They evaluate these 6 combinations of CM datasets on GLUECoS benchmark. They empirically find out that naturally occurring code-mixed data (r-CM) brings in the best performance improvement after fine-tuning, against synthetic fine-tunings (l-CM, g-CM) and even plain mBERT. Other task specific observations include: fine-tuning with r-CM data helps with SENT, NER, LID and QA CM tasks. General trend observed was easier tasks like LID, POS are solved in earlier layers and as complexity of tasks increases, the effective layer moves deeper. This paper’s other significant contribution is to visualize the differences to these mBERT attention heads post-CM-fine-tuning. They use three methods (including one of their own contribution), which try to answer questions related to: Has anything changed within the models due to pre-training with CM datasets? Attention patterns of which heads have changed? How do attention heads respond to code-mixed probes?. There are changes to these models, which show these attention heads are receptive to CM specific data at different layers of mBERT for different tasks and different language pairs. The most important finding from these probing experiments is that there are discernible changes introduced in the models due to exposure to CM data, of which a particularly interesting observation is that this exposure increases the overall responsivity of the attention heads to CM. Session - 4 (Speech Recognition) Paper : Exploiting Monolingual Speech Corpora for Code-mixed Speech Recognition Presenter : Kriti Anandan This paper aims to mitigate the problem of scarcity in code-mixed datasets for training ASR models robust to code-mixed data. It introduces two algorithms to synthetically generate code mixed data by using annotated monolingual data sets that are available in large quantities and a small amount of annotated real code-mixed data. Both these algorithms make use of probability distributions derived from real code-mixed data to imitate their characteristics. The code-mixed sentences are framed from sentence fragments extracted from the monolingual corpus. In the paper, first algorithm is a naïve approach that uses the code-mixed language span distributions to weave fragments of two different languages in an alternate fashion where fragment lengths are picked by sampling the distribution. The second algorithm uses two distributions that try to model phone transitions across fragments and within fragments. The authors also demonstrate the usefulness of these synthetically generated datasets by adding them to the existing monolingual dataset for training the acoustic model of an ASR. Results from the best acoustic model show a ~ 6. 85 point drop in WER score. They also conduct some language modelling experiments by using code-mixed transcripts to train the language model of the ASR. The best system uses the best acoustic model trained from the previous experiment and the language model trained on the synthetic text generated by all the algorithms presented, as well as the real code-mixed text. The results via this method show a ~ 8. 17 point drop in the WER score. Session - 5 (Speech Recognition) Paper : Learning to recognize code switched speech without forgetting monolingual speech recognition Presenter : Shahid Nagra The goal of the paper is to fine tune ASR models on code switched speech without affecting the performance on the same models on monolingual speech. They propose the use of a learning without forgetting algorithm. This approach can also be used when one doesn’t have access to the monolingual data that the model was trained on, which is often the case for open-source ASR models. They conducted 5 experiments where training and fine-tuning is varied across the 3 datasets, monolingual and code-mixed and pooled. The best model performance is got when fine-turning a model on pooled data (code-mixed + monolingual) where only 25% of code-mixed data is used. An extra KL Diverge loss between the fine-tuned and the pre-trained model is added to prevent the increase in WER on the monolingual data. A metric poWER is also introduced which measures the Levenstein distance between the phonemic representation of utterances which takes care of measuring WER in the code-mixed setting. Session - 6 (Speech Synthesis) Paper : Code-Switched Speech Synthesis Using Bilingual Phonetic Posteriorgram with Only Monolingual Corpora Presenter : Shangeth Rajaa This paper aims to synthesize fluent code-switched speech using only monolingual speech corpora and explores the usage of Bilingual Phonetic Posteriorgram(PPG) as the speech representation. PPGs are the posterior probabilities of each phonetic class for a specific frame of one utterance, stacking up the PPG for two languages forms the bilingual PPG. As obtaining a bilingual/code-switched speech corpus for TTS training can be expensive, this paper solves the problem, by training a tacotron2 based code-switched TTS system with only the monolingual corpus of both the languages(English and Chinese) where each language is spoken by a different speaker. The trained model is then evaluated by generating speech for a code-switched text corpus with Mean Opinion Score(MOS) score. The paper introduces the use of Bilingual PPG as a representation of speech as PPGs are speaker-independent and can capture the context of the speech better, PPG features are computed with a pretrained ASR model for each language. They replaced the traditional acoustic model which predicts the acoustic features(Mel Spectrogram) directly from text, to predict the PPG from the text, followed by predicting the Mel Spectrogram from the predicted PPG, speaker embedding and language embedding. The proposed method also includes a residual encoder to encode the speech into a latent space in a Variational AudioEncoder(VAE) setting which helps to model the prosodic features of the audio. The proposed method was compared with a tacotron2 based text to acoustic feature(Mel spectrogram) model baseline. As the proposed method uses a PPG feature, the model was able to disentangle the context information of the speech signal across different speakers and synthesize better code-mixed speech by combining the PPG feature, speaker embedding, language embedding, and prosody features. From the experimental results, we can observe that the proposed method can synthesize high intelligible code-switched speech with a cross-lingual speaker(eg: Chinese speaker for English/code-switched text) with only training on a monolingual corpus. But the proposed method failed to beat the baseline in speech fidelity MOS score. The authors stated that the Bilingual PPG extracted was not accurate enough and needs to be further studied in future work. Do check out the blog on Code-Mixing metrics if you haven’t already.

    "body": "2021/08/09 - We, at vernacular, recently concluded a seminar series on code-mixing, where we covered research papers that looked at approaches to deal with code-mixed data across ASR, TTS and SLU related services. Code-mixing is a common phenomena in the Indian subcontinent. Code-mixing refers to the situation when two or more languages are present in an utterance or a corpus. It is important to formulate, discuss and deliberate on metrics because, it is improvement on metrics across benchmark datasets that spur continuous research in a field. TerminologiesBecause how can one study a phenomena without having a requisite vocabulary.  Matrix Language : The Matrix Language-Frame (MLF) model is one of the dominant models to analyse code-switching. In this framework there is a Matrix Language and an Embedded Language. The embedding language is inserted into the mono-syntactic frame of the Matrix language.  Inter-sentential switching : Occurs outside the sentence or the clause level Intra-sentential switching : Occurs within a sentence or a clause Intra-word switching : Occurs within a word itself, sometimes at phoneme boundaries example : “I’m chalaaoing a car” → “i am driving a car” Language Span: The number of monolingual words between 2 consecutive switch points in the corpus. The language span distribution is the aggregate of all such language spans into a discrete pdf. The performance of models on code-mixed corpora, would depend on the level of code-mixing. A minuscule level of code-mixing could be treated as noise/OOV and ignored. However, as the level of code-mixing increases, the performance of the model will vary. Therefore it is important to quantify the extent of code-mixing in a corpora; “how much” and“how often”. In the first paper covered in the code-mixing seminar, there were several metrics presented, however they were not discussed in detail. We discuss them below. Measuring the amount of Code-MixingWord-frequency based metrics: Code-Mixing Index (CMI) : An utterance level metric that measures the fraction of tokens(words) that are not from the matrix language. [CMI = 100*(1 - \frac{max(w_i)}{n-u}) \text{ if } n&gt;u] where,n = total number of words, irrespective of languageu = language independent words\(w_i\) = number of words in language i\(max(w_i)\) measures the number of words in the matrix language If \(n=u\) i. e. if the utterance contains only language independent words then CMI = 0. One way calculate CMI for the entire corpus is to just calculate the above at a corpus level rather than an utterance level. However, this method doesn’t take into account the switching frequency. Another way is to combine the utterance level CMI as discussed here. Multilingual Index (M-index) : Quantifies the ratio of languages in the corpora based on the Gini coefficient to measure the inequality distribution of languages in the corpus. [M-index = \frac{1-\sum p_j^2}{(k-1). \sum p_j^2}] where,k = number of languages\(p_j\) = number of words in language j divided by total number of words The M-index = 0 when the corpus is monolingual and = 1 when there is equal distribution of token across all the languages i. e. \(p_j\) for all \(j = 1/k\). Language Entropy (LE) : An information theoretic alternative to the M-index. Measures the number of bits required to describe the distribution of language tags. [LE = -\sum_{1…k} p_i*log_2(p_i)] where,k = number of languages\(p_i\) = number of words in language j divided by total number of words This metric is 0 for a monolingual corpus and is bounded by \(log_2(k)\) for equally distributed k languages. Both LE and M-index can be derived from one another. However, just specifying the frequency of words belonging to another language doesn’t provide enough information. A corpus with a higher frequency of language switches per utterance is more complex, therefore we need some measures on the frequency and distribution of code-switching points. Measuring code-switching: Probability of Switching (I-index) : The average number of switch points in the corpus. [f_n = P/(N-1)] where,\(P\) = number of code-switching points\(N-1\) = possible switching points in a corpus that contains n tokens A token is considered a switch point, if the preceding token is from another language. Time-course Metrics: Since, a corpus is a sequential document, it is informative to have a time-series metrics that quantifies the temporal distribution of code-switching across the corpora. Burstiness : Measures whether code switching occurs in bursts or is periodic is nature. It compares the code-switching behaviour in the corpus to a poisson behaviour where code-switching occurs at random. Let, \(\mu_t\) = mean language span and \(\sigma_t\) = s. t. of language span, then [Burstiness = \frac{\sigma_t-\mu_t}{\sigma_t+\mu_t}] Burstiness is bounded by \([-1,1]\). For, corpus that have a periodicity in code-switching points, this value is closer to -1 and for corpuses that have less predictable periodicity have a value closer to 1. Span Entropy (SE) : An information theoretic measure of the language span distribution i. e. the number of bits needed to describe the probability distribution. [SE = -\sum_{1…M} p_l*log_2(p_l)] where,\(p_l\) is the sample probability of a language span of length lM is the maximum language span Memory : The above two metrics don’t make any claims about the time ordering of the language spans i. e. say if a long span occurs below or after the current span, then there would be no difference in the above metric values. Corpus’ with the same burstiness can have very different properties. This metric measures the extent to which the \(i^{th}\) span length is influenced by span lengths occurring before it. This metric is bounded by \([-1,1]\). When it is closer to -1, then the length of consecutive spans in negative correlated i. e. long spans followed by short ones. Evaluating Code-Mixed ASR and TTSASR: Conventional word error rate is not sufficient for measuring the performance of code-mixed models due to cross-transcription, misspellings and borrowing of words. One of the issues for transcription of code-mixed speech is transliteration. For example, say the actual transcripts contain first two words of a sentence in Devanagari and the last 2 in Roman but the transcripts from ASR contain only Roman script. Then unless we have transliteration, we can’t get accurate WER scores. This issue is further compounded by non-uniform transliteration standards, across both the training data and the eval data especially since languages often borrow words from other languages. However, there are no standard metrics that exist as of now. Below two metrics that measure different aspects are discussed. CM-WER : If there are M words on both sides of switch points across all reference transcriptions and N edits in the ASR hypotheses corresponding to words surrounding the switch points in the references, then \(\text{CM-WER} = \frac{N}{M}\) . This metric provides an estimate of how accurately the system predicts words at switch points. poWER : Prononciation Optimised WER. It is defined as the Levenshtein distance between the pronunciation optimized hypothesis (H) and reference (R) sentence, normalised by the number of words in the reference sentence. [\text{poWER} = \text{LevDist}(f(H), f(R))/N] Here, \(f\) = grapheme-to-phoneme (g2p) conversion of each word in the sentence So, for example, the following below sentences would have a poWER of zero. HYP : रूम service आपको कै सी लगREF : room service आपको कै सी लग TTS: Degradation MOS : Annotators listen to a sample audio which is considered to have no degradation. The next audio is rated in comparison to that, in terms of degradation, out of 5. A score of 5 means no degradation, a score of 1 means the highest degradation. While testing a code-mixed TTS, it one can use degradation score of monolingual sentences generated from Multi-lingual TTS as compared to Mono-lingual TTS. Notes:  The above measures can be used to specify different patterns of code switching which have been termed as “code-switching attitudes”. These can be thought of as aspects of personality and are correlated with regional identities and other trait properties. If you have any questions please reach out to swaraj@vernacular. ai.

    "title": "Normalizing Flows - Part 2",
    "body": "2021/05/08 - In Part-1, we introduced the concept of normalizing flows. Here, we discuss the different types of normalizing flows. In most blogs that discuss Normalizing Flows, several concepts related to autoregressive flows and residual flows aren’t discussed very clearly. We hope to simplify the explanations of a relatively theoretical topic and make them accessible. Topics Covered: Element-wise Flows Linear Flows Planar and Radial Flows Coupling Flows Autoregressive Flows     Masked Autoregressive Flows   Inverse Autoregressive Flows    Residual Flows Convolutions and NFsElement-wise FlowsThis is the simplest normalizing flow. In this case, the bijective function \(T\) can be broken into individual components i. e.  \(T(x_1, x_2. . . x_d) = (h_1(x_1), h_2(x_2). . . h_d(x_d))\) s. t. every \(h_i\) is a transform from \(R \rightarrow R\). Each dimension has its own bijective function. However, these simple flows don’t capture any dependency between dimensions. Some activation functions like Parametric Leaky RELU (bijective) can be considered element-wise NFs. Linear FlowsLinear flows are able to capture correlations between dimensions and are of the form : \(T(x) = Ax+b\) , where \(A \in R^{D*D}\) and \(b \in R^D\) where \(D\) is the dimensionality of the input. For the transform T to be invertible, only the matrix A needs to be invertible. When matrix A is a non-diagonal matrix, it captures correlation between different dimensions. Linear flows are limited in their expressive power. Starting out with a Gaussian \(z \sim N(\mu, \sigma)\), we simply arrive at another Gaussian \(z' = N(A*\mu+b, A^T*\sigma*A)\), similarly for other distributions. However, they serve as important building blocks for NFs. In terms of computational complexity, computing the determinant and inverse are both of order \(O(D^3)\) where \(D\) is the dimensionality of matrix A. To make the calculation more efficient, there need to be some restrictions on A. Possible restrictions on A:  A is a diagonal matrix: this reduces computation time for the calculation of the det. and inverse to \(O(D)\). However, this is equivalent to element-wise bijections.  A is a triangular matrix: It is more expressive than a diagonal matrix. The computation time for calculation of the determinant is \(O(D)\) and for the inverse is \(O(D^2)\).  A is an orthogonal matrix: Inverse of an orthogonal matrix is simply its transpose and the determinant is either \(\pm 1\). There are some other methods that use LU factorisations, QR decomposition which essentially exploit matrix properties to make the computation of inverse and determinant efficient and at the same time allow A to be more expressive. Planar and Radial FlowsThey were first introduced in Rezende and Mohamed [2015], but aren’t widely used in practice and therefore not covered in details here. Planar flows expand/contract the distribution around a certain direction (specified by a plane) and radial flows modify the distribution around specific points. The effect of the flows can be seen below. The left half shows the effect of planar NFs on an initial distribution of a Gaussian and uniform distribution, and the right half shows the effect of a radial flow.   Fig 1 : Examples of planar and radial flows on initial distributions like Gaussian and uniform distributions. Coupling FlowsCoupling flows are highly expressive and widely used flow architectures. They can either have linear or non-linear invertible transformations. Coupling flows are defined by two sets of mappings, an identity map and a coupling function \(h\). Consider a disjoint partition of the input \(x \in \mathbb{R}\) into two subspaces: \((x^A, x^B)\) \(\in\) \(\mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}^{D-d}\).  A bijective differentiable coupling function is defined as, \(h(\cdot ;\theta)\) : \(\mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{D}\) that is parameterized by \(\theta\).  The equations for both the mappings are shown below. \(y^A\) = \(h(x^A, \theta(x^B))\)  \(y^{B}\) = \(x^B\) The bijection \(h\) is called a coupling function, and the resulting function \(g\) that consists of both the mappings is called a coupling flow. Coupling flow is invertible if and only if \(h\) is invertible and has an inverse. Let’s consider an example : Let us consider an input with 4 dimensions \((x1,x2,x3,x4)\). Let \(x^A = (x1,x2)\) and \(x^B = (x3,x4)\). Let \(\theta(x^B) = x3+x4\) and let the coupling function \(h(x^A, \theta(x^B)) = \theta(x^B) * x^A\). Given this example, the coupling function \(h\) is invertible but only if \(\theta\) isn’t zero. Therefore, the invertibility requirement of \(h\) introduces a limitation on \(\theta\) as well. In this case, it can’t be defined as a simple additive function. The restriction for non-zero values needs to be taken into account.   Fig 2 : Example coupling flow architectures. The figure above shows two examples of coupling flow architectures. In figure (a), \(x^{A}\) and \(x^{B}\) are the two input subspaces. The coupling function \(h\) is applied to \(x^{A}\) directly while it is parameterized on \(x^{B}\). In figure (b), there are two subsequent flows, where the size of input subspace on which the coupling function \(h\) is applied, gradually increases with each flow. There are various types of coupling functions. We discuss some of these briefly,  Additive coupling     This is one of the simplest form of coupling functions defined by, \(h(x;\theta) =\) \(x + \theta\),   where \(\theta\) is a constant \(\in \mathbb{R}\)    Affine coupling     \(h(x;\theta) =\) \(\theta_1x + \theta_2\),   \(\theta_1 \neq 0\), \(\theta_2 \in \mathbb{R}\) Both additive and affine coupling were introduced in NICE.     Neural auto-regressive flows     This was first introduced by Huang et al [2018]. The coupling function \(h(\cdot;\theta)\) is modelled as a neural network. Every neural network can be considered as a parameterized function, the parameters being the weights. In this case, the weights of the neural network are defined by \(\theta\). To ascertain that the neural network follows bijectivity, the following proposition is applied :         If \(NN(\cdot)\) : \(\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) is a multilayer perceptron, such that all weights are positive and all activation functions are strictly monotone, then \(NN({\cdot})\) is a strictly monotone function.  So, since the neural network is monotone, it is also invertible and hence a normalizing flow.           More types of coupling flows can be found in this paper. Autoregressive FlowsAn autoregressive flow is a type of normalizing flow where the transformations use autoregressive functions. The term autoregressive originates from time-series models where the predictions at the current time-step are dependent on the observations from the previous time-steps. The probability distribution of an autoregressive model is given by, the equation below where the output at time-step \(i\) is conditioned on all the previous outputs.       [p(x) = \prod_{i=1. . D} p(x_i   x_{1:i-1})]   An autoregressive function can be represented as a coupling flow: Let the coupling function \(h(\cdot ;\theta)\) : \(\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) be a bijection parameterized by \(\theta\), and let \(x_{1:t}\) be the set of inputs Then, an autoregressive model is a function \(g : \mathbb{R}^D \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^D\), in which every entry of the output \(y = g(x)\) is conditioned on the previous entries of the input: [y_t = h(x_t ; \theta_t(x_{1:t-1})] The functions \(\theta_t(\cdot)\) are called conditioners. \(\theta_1\) is a constant whereas \(\theta_2\), \(\theta_3\) … , \(\theta_t\) are arbitrary functions mapping \(\mathbb{R}_{t-1}\) to the set of all parameters. The conditioners need to be arbitrarily complex for effective transformations and hence, are usually modelled as neural networks. Since each output depends only on the previous inputs, the Jacobian matrix of an autoregressive transformation \(g\) is triangular (refer to Part 1 for explanation). The determinant of a triangular matrix is simply a product of its diagonal entries.       [\det{(Dg)} = \prod_{t=1. . k}   \frac{\partial y_t}{\partial x_t}   ]   Masked Autoregressive Flows (MAFs): The time taken to train autoregressive flow models is very high because of the need to sequentially generate outputs. Using MAFs one can parallelize the training process. MAFs were inspired by the observation that on stacking several autoregressive models, where each model had unimodal conditionals, the normalizing flow can learn multi-modal conditionals (MAF [2018]). The architecture consists of stacked MADEs with Gaussian conditionals which are explained below. What are MADEs? MADE stands for Masked Auto-Encoder for Distribution Estimation (MADE [2015]) are essentially auto-encoders with some modifications like masks. In a MADE, the autoregressive property is enforced by multiplying the weight matrices of the hidden layers of the auto-encoder with a binary mask. These masks ensure that the training of the sequential auto-regressive model can be done in parallel. The masking is done such that forward passes with mask are equivalent to conditioning the output only on the earlier sequences of input. This is shown in the below image. On the left, a typical auto-encoder with 2 hidden layers is shown. If one wants to represent the output as an autoregressive sequence specified by the equation below, then masks are multiplied to the weights of the auto-encoder.       [p(x) = p(x_2) * p(x_3   x_2) * p(x_1   x_2, x_3)]   The order of the inputs are \(x_2, x_3, x_1\) The image on the right shows the network weights after masking. For example \(p(x_2)\) doesn’t depend on any of the other inputs since it is the first in the sequence. \(p(x_3)\) is dependent on only the nodes that depend on \(x_2\) and similarly for \(p(x_1)\) The general form for masking is discussed in the MADE paper. The MADE architecture parallelizes the sequential autoregressive computation.   Fig 3 : This image is taken from the MADE paper an explains the idea of masking, so as to parallelizes the sequential autoregressive computation. Density Estimation and Sampling: There are two important concepts when studying flow architectures : density estimation and sampling. Both these passes have different computation complexity and for auto-regressive models, the computation time of one is inversely related to the other.   Fig 4 : Forward pass of MAFs (left) vs. Inverse pass of MAFs (right). The diagrams above demonstrate a forward pass and an inverse pass in a MAF. The output \(x_i's\) depends upon the input \(z_{i}\) and the scalars \(\alpha_{i}\), \(\mu_{i}\) which are computed using \(x_{1:t-1}\).  It is these scalars that define the density parameters of the distribution. This is also called a scale and shift transform. The reason why it is designed this way is that inverting \(f(x)\) does not require us to invert the scalar functions \(\alpha_{i}\) and \(\mu_{i}\). \(f^{-1}(x_{i}) = z_{i} = \frac{x_{i} - \mu_{i}}{exp(\alpha_{i})}\). MAFs can compute the density \(p(x)\) very efficiently. During the training process, all the \(x_i's\) are known. One can therefore parallelize this step using masks. Sampling on the other hand (predicting \(x_{D}\)) is slower as it requires it requires performing \(D\) sequential passes (where \(D\) is the dimensionality of \(x\)) to calculate the previous samples (\(x_{1}, x_{2} . . . x_{D-1}\)) before computing \(x_{D}\). Inverse Autoregressive Flows (IAFs):   Fig 5 : Inverse pass of MAF (left) vs. Forward pass of IAF (right). Since MAFs are better at training by exploiting parallel computation but slower during sampling, we modify the functions to get another flow architecture that is faster at sampling. This gives us Inverse Autoregressive flows (IAFs). The figures above show a comparison between the inverse pass of a MAF and the forward pass in an IAF.  The only difference between both the architectures is that for IAF’s the autoregression is based on the latent variables and not the predicted distribution. The scale(\(\alpha_{i}\)) and shift(\(\mu_{i}\)) quantities are computed using previous data points from the base distribution instead of the transformed distribution. IAF can generate samples efficiently with one pass through the model since all the \(z_i's\) are known. However, the training process is slow, since estimating the \(z_i\) requires i sequential passes to calculate all the required input variables \(z_{1}\), \(z_{2}\), . . \(z_{i-1}\). Aside : According to our understanding, during training, both the weights of the network parameters(\(\alpha, \mu\)) and \(z_i's\) are estimated i. e. the ith latent variable is itself treated as a parameter that is to be learned. One should use IAFs if fast sampling is needed, and MAFs if fast density estimation is desirable. Parallel WaveNet [2017] which was once the state-of-art model for speech synthesis made use of a MAF and an IAF. A fully trained “teacher” network that used MAF architecture was used to train a smaller and parallel “student” network that used IAF architecture. Since the teacher used MAF architecture it could be trained fast. Once the student network, an IAF model, was trained, it could then generate all the audio samples in parallel without depending on the previously generated audio samples and with no loss in audio quality. Residual FlowsDuring training, deep networks find it difficult to reach a convergence point due to the vanishing/exploding gradient. In such cases, adding more layers to the network only results in a higher training error. Residual Networks or ResNets were introduced to solve this problem. ResNets consist of skip-connection blocks. A residual block is shown below. The output of the residual block is represented by the equation below, where \(F(x)\) represented the pass through the neural layers. [M(x) = F(x) + x]   Fig 6 : A residual block. How does this help?Skip connections in a deep neural network allow the back-propagation signal to reach the initial layers of the neural network thereby solving the vanishing gradient problem. Instead of treating the number of layers as an important hyper-parameter to tune, by adding skip connections to our network, we are allowing the network to skip training for the layers that are not useful and do not add value to overall accuracy. In a way, skip connections make our neural networks dynamic, so that they may optimally tune the number of layers during training. Residual flows in their general form aren’t invertible and can only be used in flow architectures after applying some constraints(first introduced in Chen et al. [2019]). This is discussed next. A Lipschitz condition is necessary to enforce invertibility in residual flows. Lipchitz condition :A real valued function : \(f : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\), is Lipchitz continuous if there exists a positive real constant \(K\) such that, for all real \(x_1\) and \(x_2\), \(|f(x_1) - f(x_2)| \leq K| x_1 - x_2 |\) If \(K = 1\) the function is called a short map, and if \(0 \leq K &lt; 1\) the function is called a contraction. Invertible Residual Flows:Given a residual flow of the form, \(F(x)=x+g(x)\), if the mapping \(g(x)\) has a lipschitz constant \(K\), \(0 \leq K &lt; 1\) then the residual flow is invertible. We discuss a short proof of this next. For the residual flow to be invertible, proving that \(F(x)\) is monotonically increasing is sufficient i. e. we need to prove \(F(x+\delta) - F(x) &gt;= 0\) [F(x+\delta) - F(x) = x+\delta + g(x+\delta) - (x - g(x)) = \delta + g(x+\delta) - g(x)] From the Lipschitz condition for \(g\), we have \(|g(x+\delta) - g(x)| \le |\delta|\), since \(0 \leq K &lt; 1\). Therefore, \(F(x+\delta) - F(x)\) is always &gt;= 0 and hence monotonically increasing. The addition of invertible residual blocks greatly enhances the class of neural network flow models and also ensures we can train deeper models without the fear of vanishing gradient. Convolutions and NFsConvolutions are one of the most common operations used in the design of DNNs, however, the computation of their inverse and determinant is non-obvious. Since they aren’t invertible they can’t be used in the family of NF flows. However, recently [Hoogeboom et al. 2019] defined invertible \(d*d\) convolutions and designed an architecture using stacked masked autoregressive convolutions. This is explained next. In the figure below, on the right, the input x is shown along with the kernel matrix w. The convolution operation between these two can be represented as a matrix multiplication of the form \(A*x\) shown on the right.  The matrix A is non-invertible here, however, if we consider \(f = g = h = i = 0\), then, we get a triangular matrix that can represent a normalizing flow.   Fig 7 : A convolution represented as a matrix multiplication. One of the issues of using a filter where \(f = g = h = i = 0\) is that the receptive field is narrow. However, one can rotate the filter and combine two filters to get different receptive fields as shown on the left in the image below. These can then which can be stacked to capture more expressive combinations as shown on the right. These are called “expressive convolutions” in the paper. The grey and orange filters are rotations of the same filter that result in a triangular matrix. They can be stacked to get different receptive fields shown in blue. These blue receptive fields can be stacked further to arrive at more expressive transforms that have the desired receptive field.   Fig 8 : The part in grey is an example of an individual kernel that would result in a triangular matrix. The grey and orange matrices are all rotations of the standard matrix and the blue matrix shows the receptive field when the grey and orange filters are combined. .

    "body": "2021/03/25 - Kaldi-Serve is our open source high performance Speech Recognition server framework capable of serving Kaldi ASR models in production environments for real-time inference, and it’s got an upgrade! What’s Changed?: Originally designed as a standalone application, kaldi-serve had some issues mostly pertaining to it’s usability or extensibility for custom use cases thus greatly reducing the core’s potential to just a handful of rigid situations and dependencies. After one too many requests for changes in the architecture to better fit the various production needs of our customers, we realised it’s time for a rewrite of the framework that allows us to better utilise the core’s scope and extend it’s capabilities in the form of general API consumable in most use cases. Library: Kaldi-Serve is now a general extensible library with all the functionality necessary to serve Kaldi ASR models in production with any server framework of your choice, for ex. gRPC, Open CGI, HTTP, etc. or even import it in your own custom offline application. The earlier standalone gRPC server is now and application that extends the core kaldi-serve library and only contains the frontend gRPC methods that call the general API. We’ll talk about how you can extend the library in your own applications below. Python Port: We also made it easier to use kaldi-serve by porting the core library to python which can be easily installed as a package via pip. The transcription interface is much simpler and faster to get up and running. Below is sample code snippet for transcribing a wav file with your Kaldi Chain model using the kaldiserve python package: from io import BytesIOfrom kaldiserve import ChainModel, Decoder, parse_model_specs, start_decoding# chain model contains all const components to be shared across multiple threadsmodel = ChainModel(parse_model_specs( model-spec. toml )[0])# initialize a decoder that references the chain modeldecoder = Decoder(model)# read audio file as byteswith open( sample. wav ,  rb ) as f:  audio_bytes = BytesIO(f. read()). getvalue()with start_decoding(decoder):  # decode the audio  decoder. decode_wav_audio(audio_bytes)  # get the n-best alternatives  alts = decoder. get_decoded_results(10)print(alts)More Features Coming Soon  Ontology GPU Inference MACE Integration"

    "title": "Normalizing Flows - Part 1",
    "body": "2020/12/19 - Normalizing flows, popularized by (Rezende, &amp; Mohamed,2015), are techniques used in machinelearning to transform simple probability distribution functions intocomplicated ones. One of the popular use cases is in generative modelling - anunsupervised learning method - where the goal is to model a probabilitydistribution given samples drawn from that distribution. Why bother about normalizing flows?:    They have been used in many TTS (text-to-speech) models, memorably in theParallel WaveNetmodel (2017) where aclever application of normalizing flows resulted in a 1000 times fastergeneration of audio samples in comparison to the originalWaveNet model. The Parallel WaveNet modelwas also deployed on Google assistant for real-time generation of audio.     Normally a back-propagation pass requires the activation value for eachneuron to be stored in memory. This places a restriction on training deeper,wider models on single GPU’s(since GPU’s have limited memory) and forces oneto use small batch sizes during training. In flow based networks, one doesnot need to store the activations at all, as they can be reconstructedonlineduring the back-propagation. This property was leveraged in the RevNetspaper (2017) which uses invertibleresidual blocks. Reducing the memory cost of storing activationssignificantly improve the ability to efficiently train wider and deepernetworks.     Flowtron (2020), an autoregressiveflow based TTS model does a kind of representation learning using normalizingflows to learn an invertible mapping from a data space to a latent spacewhich can be manipulated to control many aspects of speech synthesis (pitch,tone, speech rate, cadence, accent). Flowtron matches state-of-the-art TTSmodels in terms of speech quality and is able to transfer speechcharacteristics from a source speaker to a target speaker, making the targetspeaker sound more expressive.     If you’ve ever thought about reversible networks, Normalizing flows doprecisely that. Reversibility of flows also means that one can triviallyencode images into the latent space for editing. They also have coolmathematical applications, for example their use in Neural ODEsolvers (2019. ) which use continuousnormalizing flows.  Brief Introduction: Definition: A Normalizing Flow is a transformation of a simpleprobability distribution into a more complex distribution by a sequence ofinvertible and differentiable mappings.  Note: The above formalism is a simplification, for a more precisedefinition one can consult [5]. The formalism allows piecewise continuousfunctions to be used in the construction of the flow which the abovedefinition restricts. Normalizing since the transformed distribution needs to be normalized bythe change of variables formula (discussed below). Flow refers to theseries of invertible transformations which are composed with each other tocreate more complex invertible transformations. When applied as density estimators, some NFs provide a general way ofconstructing flexible probability distributions over continuous randomvariables starting from a simple probability distribution. By constraining thetransformations to be invertible, Flow-based models provide a tractable methodto calculate the exact likelihood for a wide variety of generative modelingproblems. Efficient inference and efficient synthesis: Autoregressive models, such asthe PixelCNN, are also reversible,however synthesis from such models is difficult to parallelize, and typicallyinefficient on parallel hardware. Flow-based generative models likeGlow (and RealNVP) are efficient toparallelize for both training and synthesis. Exact latent-variable inference: Within the class of exact likelihoodmodels, normalizing flows provide two key advantages: model flexibility andgeneration speed. Flows have been explored both to increase the flexibility ofthe variational posterior in the context of variational autoencoders (VAEs),and directly as a generative model.  With VAEs, one is able to infer onlyapproximately the value of the latent variables that correspond to a datapoint. GAN’s have no encoder at all to infer the latents. In flow based generativemodels, this can be done exactly without approximation. Not only does this leadto accurate inference, it also enables optimization of the exact log-likelihoodof the data, instead of a lower bound of it. Mathematical Framework: Let, \(z_0\) be a continuous random variable belonging to a simple probability distribution \(p_\theta(z_0)\) . Let it be a Gaussian with parameters \((\mu, \sigma) = (0,1)\). [z_0 \sim p_\theta (z_0) = N(z_0;0,1)] Normalizing flows transforms the simple distribution, into a desired output probability distribution with random variable \(x\), with a sequence of invertible transformations, \(f_i's\). [z_k = f_\theta (z_0) = f_k…f_2. f_1(z_0) \text{ s. t. each $f_i$ is invertible (bijective)}] The composition of all the individual flows is represented by \(f_\theta\). Since each \(f_i\) is bijective, so is \(f_\theta\). The new density \(p_\theta (z_k)\) is called a push forward of the initial density \(p_\theta(z_0)\) by the function \(f_\theta. \) An example of a transformation obtained by a normalizing flow is shown below, which transforms a base gaussian distribution into a target multi-modal distribution with the help of a bijective function.   Fig 1: The transformation of a base distribution into a target distribution using a bijective function f. The constrains of a distribution being a probability distribution is that \(\int p_\theta (z_0) =1\). However, this doesn’t hold after applying a bijective function (for intuition consider \(f_1 : z \rightarrow z^3\)). Change of Variables Formula: Consider the normalizing flow \(f_1 : Z_0 \rightarrow Z_1\).  If we want the probability distribution of the random variable \(z_1 \sim Z_1\), we need to consider the change of variables formula derived below. Consider the event \(z_0 \sim Z\), mapped to \(z_1 \sim Z_1\) s. t. \(f_1(z_0) = z_1\). Since, the mapping is bijective, the probabilities of the events are the same. Therefore, [p_\theta(z_1)\partial z_1 = p_\theta(z_0)\partial z_0] [p_\theta(z_1) = p_\theta(z_0)* \frac{\partial z_0}{\partial z_1}]       [p_\theta(z_1) = p_\theta(z_0)*   \frac{\partial z_0}{\partial z_1}   ]   (since probabilities are always &gt; 0)       [p_\theta(z_1) = p_\theta(z_0)*   \frac{\partial z_0}{\partial f_1(z_0)}   ]   (\(z_1 = f_1(z_0)\))       [p_\theta(z_1) = p_\theta(z_0)*   \frac{\partial f_1(z_0)}{\partial z_0}   ^{-1}]   In the multivariate case (\(R^D \rightarrow R^D\)) this generalises to:       [p_\theta(z_1) = p_\theta(z_0)*   \det(\frac{\partial f_1(z_0)}{\partial z_0})   ^{-1}]   Considering the sequence of compositional transformations \(f_i's\), one obtains:       [p_\theta(z_k) = p_\theta(z_0)* \prod_{i=1. . k}   \det(\frac{\partial f_i}{\partial z_{i-1}})   ^{-1}]   The term on the right i. e. determinant of the Jacobian accounts for the changeof \(\delta\) volume induced by the transformation. It serves to normalize thetransformed distribution locally, after each flow through a transformation,hence the name, Normalizing Flows. Some Questions at this stage:  The sequence of flows need to be invertible and differentiable. What sort ofconstraints does it introduce in terms of the output distributions that canbe reached? Are there families of distributions that we can’t reach startingfrom a Gaussian?Sampling: In this case, the bijective functions and the initial distribution are given. Sampling points from the output distribution requires calculating the forward pass, i. e. an efficient calculation of the functions \(f_i's\). Density Estimation using Maximum Likelihood: In this case a dataset \(\{a_1, a_2,. . . . ,a_n\}\) is provided and the objective is to learn the probability density function \(p_\theta(A)\) to which the points belong. An initial density \(p_\theta(z_0)\) is chosen. For each \(a_i\) we have:       [p_\theta(a_i) = p_\theta(z_i)*   \det(\frac{\partial f(z_i)}{\partial z_i})   ^{-1}]   where, \(a_i = f(z_i)\)       [\prod_{i=1}^n p_\theta(a_i) =\prod_{i=1}^n [p_\theta(z_i)*   \det(\frac{\partial f(z_i)}{\partial z_i})   ^{-1}]]   We need to maximize the above over all possible flows \(f\) to find the flow \(\hat{f}\) that maximizes the probability.       [\hat{f} =\text{arg max}f \text{ }\prod{i=1}^n [p_\theta(z_i)*   \det(\frac{\partial f(z_i)}{\partial z_i})   ^{-1}]]   Using log likelihood maximization we arrive at:       [\hat{f} =\text{arg max}f \text{ }\sum{i=1}^n [log(p_\theta(z_i)) - log(   \det(\frac{\partial f(z_i)}{\partial z_i})   )]]   The equation shown above is used during training for density estimation. However, since we only know \(a_i's\) the only way to find \(z_i's\) which are used, is to find the inverse mapping i. e. \(z_i = f^{-1}(a_i)\) .  So for density estimation and training, the calculation of both the inverse and determinant of the Jacobian are required. However, calculating the inverse and the determinant of the Jacobian of a sequence of high dimensional transformations can be very time consuming (for dimensionality \(d\) matrix, both are of complexity \(O(d^3)\)). There are various tricks that are used to reduce the complexity of these two operations, one of the popular ones being the use of triangular maps. Triangular maps:: Let \(T\) be a normalizing flow, \(T: z \rightarrow x\) where \(x = (x_1, x_2 . . . . x_d)\) and \(z = (z_1, z_2 . . . . z_d)\). More generally, one can decompose \(T\) into \(T_1, T_2. . . T_d\) such that \(x_i = T_i(z_1,z_2. . . . . z_d)\). Now if we want to introduce an additional constraint on \(T\) i. e. for \(T\) to be a triangular map, each \(T_j\) should be a function of \((z_1,z_2. . . . . z_j)\) i. e. the first \(j\) elements and not all the \(d\) elements. For triangular maps/matrices, both the inverse and the determinant of the jacobian is easy to compute. The jacobian for a triangular map is shown below. The determinant is simply the product of the diagonals and has a complexity of \(O(d)\) instead of \(O(d^3)\). The complexity for the calculation of the inverse is \(O(d^2)\) instead of \(O(d^3)\).   Fig 2: The jacobian for a triangular map. This is taken from here. Note: For an increasing triangular map, \(\frac {\partial T_i}{\partial z_i} &gt; 0\). This will be useful in Part - 2 where the different types/families of Normalizing flows will be considered.

But instead of posting those or going with awhat-we-think-about-the-conference style post, we thought to just ask the teamwhat interested them the most in a few sentences. Here are the individualresponses: Abhinav says  I really liked the ZeroSpeech challenge. As usual,they had few really interesting unsupervised problems and solutions. I findtheir tracks really ambitious as evident by this statement on their website“… infants learn to speak their native language, spontaneously, from rawsensory input, without supervision from text or linguists. It should bepossible to do the same in machines”.  Next year, 2021, the target is Spoken LanguageModeling. Looking forward to that too. Amresh says  The Meta Learning Tutorial on day 1 was a detailed session on the topic. Thepromise of performing well on a set of task(s) with less amount of data had myattention. The authors take care of introduction, utility and comparison ofthis approach and its impact on tasks like speaker verification, keywordspotting, Emotion Recognition and my special interest conversational AI. Manas says  A new thing here was Computational Paralinguistics, that covers thenon-content parts of speech. Given my interest in the stylistic parts ofspeech, this was particularly interesting. Papers presented many ideasrelevant to building a better voicebot, like - uncertainty aware methods formultiple labels, Autism Quotient as a perception feature, and predicting CSATscores from sentiment. Prabhsimran says  Interspeech had some great sessions, from discussions on more fundamentalconcepts related to Speech Processing in the Brain, Phonetics and Phonology tonovel ideas on Training Strategies for ASR like Semantic Word Masking,Efficient Vocoder implementations for faster Neural Waveform Synthesis andAutomatic Prosody Analysis for Non-Semantic Speech Representations. It helpedme connect alot of dots and exposed me to some great ideas we should beexploring in our work. Kaustav says  I really liked attending the Speech Emotion Recognition tracks. The trackscovered a multitude of topics including self-supervised learning methods,non-semantic representations, etc. It was overall, a very balanced track witha lot of interaction among the attendees and the presenters. The speech signalrepresentation track was pretty fun too with some really interesting papers onvoice casting, universal non-semantic representations. "

    "title": "Reading Sessions",
    "body": "2020/11/30 - Studying researches and building on top of them is an important part of what ateam of ML Engineers do on a regular basis. Usually, teams do this by organizingperiodic, often weekly, paper reading sessions. Here is a snippet from aninternal work memo by Manas explaining how welook at these sessions:  Lets start with the basic motivation behind these sessions - we wantto read more papers. But beyond this individual goal, there is alsothe simpler driving force of enthusiasm - we read something we like,and we want to share it. It is the same instinct that drives us totalk about books we read, movies we watch, and podcasts we listen to. …  There are also secondary benefits, like knowledge transfer - bothspeaker and audience will understand the topic better after a goodpresentation - and discovering shared interests within a larger group,etc. But it’s not that easy to bring this in practice. Specially in a startup, whereprocesses and structures are constantly in flux. As the team size keeps growing,different kinds of diversities start interfering. Diversities in interests,reading styles, and even bandwidth. This post covers how we organize reading sessions in the ML team atVernacular. ai. It might be helpful if you are tryingto do the same in your group. The very first thing that we did was to start asking people for researchpapers that they like, weekly. After voting on one, the proposer of thepaper presented it on a predetermined day. This lost steam away after awhile because of various reasons. One of them being bandwidth crunch foreveryone that time. We were just 3 people. We revived paper reading after a while. This time everyone picked andpresented a paper of their own liking. This wasn’t supposed to scale upwith team size, but we went with this for a decent while. While we werefree to choose and read whatever we wanted, lack of continuity inreadings, practical disconnects and difference in interests started toreduce the overall engagement. After lockdown, the engagement level dropped further. On video calls,you have to upgrade the quality of meetings if you want to maintain thesame level of participation. The missing modalities hurt significantly. We spent inordinate amount of time trying to get to one single view onhow to go about these sessions. We tried experimenting with variousaspects like paper selection, accountability, presentationaccessibility, etc. Rather than going in those experiments in chronological order, it makessense to think about the problems from two angles based on what we knownow. You can say that the sessions are having certain issues, oralternatively you can say that the people are having issues with thesessions. While both feed on each other and are cyclic, it helps to lookat them separately. Sessions: We can break down sessions temporarily in the following three acts. 1. Pre Session: Here it’s known that a certain session is supposed to happen. You cando the following in preparation:  Set clear expectations. What is supposed to be covered? How it’ssupposed to be covered? Who should come? What will be the outcome?etc.  Excite the potential audience. If the audience is not really awareof the topic, some amount of pre-work needs to be done to pull themin. 2. Session: During the session, you want to:  Make the presentation stimulating and engaging.  Keep the presentation accessible while not being superficial.  Develop practical connections between the audience and content. 3. Post Session: Since you want the next sessions to be successful too, you would liketo:  Make sure people are going away with a healthy amount of thoughtfood.  Nudge towards the utilitarian aspects of concepts discussed so thataudience have a few threads of experimentation to follow in their dayto day work. People: For people, we can think along the following lines1:  Resourcefulness.  Motivation.  Interests, their depths, and varieties.  Style and method of working with new knowledge.  Level of comfort with group sessions. Both for presentation anddiscussion.  Bandwidth. Specially considering industrial settings like ours.  Structural assistance and pushes. Acting on all these factors to deliver a single style of session thatworks for everyone is impossible. Not all factors might be important fora team at a given moment of time, but even a reasonably small set issufficiently diverse. The key idea is accept a pluralistic view on theissue. There is no single fundamentally correct way of doing thesesessions, and it’s better to pick a digestible subset and solve for that. Going ahead with this realization, we started doing seminars. Seminars: Reading Seminars are very similar to seminar courses in Universities. From another internal memo:  These [Seminars] exist to complement the world of paper readings. While Paper Reading sessions are about reading more papers andsharing what we like, Reading Seminars are about learning somethingspecific. These are much more structured and pointed towards a goal. The idea is to have deeper discussions, over longer periods of time,about topics that might interest you. Either directly or indirectly,this will lead to a better output (from the speaker) and experience(for the audience) in the Paper Reading sessions that follow. Seminars cover many of the issues nicely and they clearly don’t toucha few others. For example you can’t just bring in any new paper anddiscuss that in a session without setting up a seminar for that field. And that’s okay. There are other ways of handling that case. At the moment, we have the following parallel seminars running:  Multi-Style TTS End-to-End ASR Speech Representation Learning Dialog State Trackers Computational Paralinguistics Learning TheoryEach of these has a list of papers or topics to be discussed over a period of1-2 months. While not perfect, these are turning out to be decent readingroadmaps for these topics. Something we would like to open out after a couple ofmonths, similar to the old stylepaper reading sessions.       Many are derived from an internal note byManas &#8617;    "

    "title": "Bad Audio Detection",
    "body": "2020/07/29 - This blog will be a short one, where we’ll talk about our approach on filteringout inscrutable audios from VASR. There are situations in Call Center Automation (CCA) pipeline where userutterances are bad. Bad here is defined by things like noise, static,silences or background murmur etc. rendering the downstream SLU systemshelpless. We started with a proposal and prepare a dataset for making an MLsystem learn to reject these audios. Benefits:  No more misfires from SLU side which ultimately leads to a better userexperience.  Save compute and time by skipping bad audios.  The whole system can be used for all our audio based tasks to predict andfilter out the poor ones, hence avoiding sample noise for these tasks. Dataset: We prepared a dataset of intent tagged conversations with specially markedintents which tell us that these utterances are bad and them going further inSLU will result in errors. Also we have a sampling of non-bad utterances(tagged with regular intents) to make this a classification problem. There are total 9928 samples of audios labelled as bad and 20000 sampleslabeled as good. All the raw labels were not very useful, hence we clean and preprocess the datato finally create 2 broad categories with sub-classes.  audio-bad     audio-noisy: Noisy audio.    audio-silent: Silent audio.    audio-talking: Background talking.    hold-phone: Music from keeping on hold.     audio-goodExploratory Data Analysis: We needed to understand the class imbalance and hence we plot a histogramrepresenting number of samples for each class.   We also plot the frequency vs duration histogram plot to understand the generaldistribution of audio durations in the dataset.  Based on the mean duration of5. 26 seconds and the peaks in the histogram, we decided to threshold our audiosto 6. 5 seconds.  Anything less than that will be padded to 6. 5 seconds andanything greater than that duration will be truncated to 6. 5 seconds. Even though we have sub-classes for audio-bad spanning different areas ofwhat “bad” could be, we decided to focus only on the noisy audios. SilentAudios can be treated separately, since they do not actually require somethingas complex as an ML model to classify them. We can simply use the age-oldpowerful signal processing methods to filter those out with some goodconfidence. Model: If we are going to reject these bad audios then we need to do so with:  High Precision: We should not be rejecting good audios which areperfectly interpretable and understandable.  Low Latency: This system should have little to no latency, otherwise itwill just slow down our whole VASR flow after being deployed and integrated.  Online: The model should be capable of running in an online setting wherecontinuous chunks of audios are fed into the system. We used a standard audio classification pipeline to train our binaryclassification task. This involves generating log-mel spectrograms and then running a ConvolutionNeural Network (CNN) based feature extractor on top of this fixed sizespectrogram image.   Binary Audio Classification based on Log-Mel SpectrogramsWhile these features (spectrograms) can be generated once after processing allthe audios in the dataset, this feature generation needs to be done on the flyto make a model that can be used in deployment i. e given raw audios as input,it should be able to predict the class, that was easily incorporated through afew transforms done within the model using torch-audio. Even though this architecture is simple, it got us an accuracy of about87%. But it is not the accuracy we need to see, our choice of metric tomeasure the performance is precision as explained earlier. We are still inthe process improving these initial baseline numbers of the model. One simpleapproach for increasing the precision is to increase the threshold, trading-offsome coverage in the form of support. Misclassification Analysis: We also do a post prediction analysis on the misclassified audios, whichrevealed an interesting pattern in the dataset and in the kind of audios thatthe model was finding hard to make predictions on. Briefly these errors followed 3 major types which now helps to understand theplaces where we can make improvements.  Type 1 (Very Short Utterance) : say 0. 2 seconds in audio of 6 seconds. Due to noise in most part of such short utterance audios, our model predictsit to be noisy and not good in some occasions. This can probably be fixedwith VAD which can trim the non speech segments in such short utteranceaudios.  Type 2 (Long audios) : Audio duration is longer than 6. 5 seconds with thespeaker in latter half. Since we chose to threshold our features (log-mels)at 6. 5 seconds, the latter part of the audio is basically truncated and hencesuch errors.  Type 3 (Ambiguous / Wrongly Labeled) : There are samples in the datasetwhich are not perfectly labelled. One may say these audios are debatablem,some may find them to be bad others may think that they are ok. This type oflabel noise is something which needs to be tackled. Needless to say, there are places where we can improve these results, buthaving a solid baseline model initially is important for incrementalimprovements over time and after a few iterations we finally see these modelsin our production systems. That’s all for now. Stay tuned to our rss feed for updates and more. "

    "title": "Speaker Diarization",
    "body": "2020/07/21 -  This blog post is based on the work done by AnirudhDagar as an intern at Vernacular. ai Diarization - Who spoke when?Speaker diarisation (or diarization) is the process of partitioning an input audio stream into homogeneous segments according to the speaker identity.  Speaker diarization is the process of recognizing “who spoke when. ” In an audio conversation with multiple speakers (phone calls, conference calls, dialogs etc. ), the Diarization API identifies the speaker at precisely the time they spoke during the conversation. Below is an example audio from calls recorded at a customer care center, where the agent is involved in a one-to-one dialog with the customer. This can be particularly hard sometimes as we’ll discuss later in the blog. Just to give an example, this audio below seems to have a lot of background talking and noise making it difficult even for a human to accurately understand speaker timestamps.     Below we have an example of an audio along with its transcription and speech timestamp tags.     Transcription: “Barbeque nation mei naa wo book kia tha ok table book kia tha han toh abhi na uske baad ek phone aaya tha toh wo barbeque nation se hi phone aaya tha mai receive nhi kar paaya toh yehi” Diarization Tag: AGENT: [(0, 5. 376), (8. 991, 12. 213)], CUSTOMER: [(6. 951, 7. 554)] What Diarization is NOT ?: There is a fine line between speaker diarization and other related speech processing tasks.    Diarization != Speaker Change Detection : Diarization systems spit a label, whenever a new speaker appears and if the same speaker comes again, it provides the same label. However, in speaker change detection no such labels are given, only the boundary of change is considered for prediction.     Diarization != Speaker Identification : The goal is not to learn the voice prints of any known speaker. Speakers’ are not registered before running the model.  Motivation  Fig 1. : ASR using Diarization tags to understand and segregate transcription. With the rise of speech recognition systems both in terms of scale and accuracy, the ability to process audio of multiple speakers is crucial and has become quintessential to understand speech today. As illustrated in Fig 1. above, information gained through diarization helps in enriching and improving Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) based on the Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transcription. It can enhance the readability of the transcription by structuring the audio stream into speaker turns and, when used together with speaker recognition systems, by providing the speaker’s true identity. This can be valuable for downstream applications such as analytics for call-center transcription and meeting transcription etc. Other than this, we at Vernacular. ai work on Call Center Automation (CCA) among many other speech domains, and, at the very core this is powered by our products VIVA and VASR. Information gained through diarization can be used to strengthen the VASR engine. How? Let me explain the goal of every customer care call support service, if you are not already aware of. The ultimate aim is to provide best in class service to the customers of the respective company. Quantitatively, measure of the service quality is based on the assessment of the AGENT’s (Call representative at customer care center) ability to disseminate relevant information to the CUSTOMER. During the quality check phase, an AGENT’s performance is scored on mutiple parameters, such as (but not limited to):  Whether the agent was patient enough listening to the customer or was rushing on the call Whether she/he was rude to the lead at any time or not Whether she/he used the proper language to communicate. For such occasions, identifying different speakers in a call (“AGENT” or “CUSTOMER”) and finally connecting different sentences under the same speaker is a critical task for the assessment quality. Speaker Diarization is the solution for those problems. Other applications involve:  Information retrieval from broadcast news.  Generating notes/minutes of meetings.  Turn-taking analysis of telephone conversations.  Call center Data analysis Court houses &amp; Parliaments.  Broadcast News(TV and Radio)DIHARD?: This is not 2x2=4. This is Diarization and IT IS HARD. One can say that it is one of the toughest ML problems intrinsically high on complexity, even for a human-being, in certain conditions. But Why??? Real world audios are not always sunshine and rainbows. They come with infinite complexities. To name a few:    In most of the conversations, people will interrupt each other, overtalk etc. , and, cutting the audio between sentences won’t be a trivial task due to this highly interactive nature.     Speakers are discovered dynamically. Although as you’ll see later, in our case we only have 2 speakers, a fixed number.   Sometimes the audio is noisy:     People talking in the background.    The microphone picking up speakers’ environment noises (roadside noises, industrial machinery noise, music in the background etc. ).     For telephony based audios, connection may be weak at times, leading to:     Audio being dropped/corrupted in some parts.    Static or just some buzzing noise creeping in the conversation and finding it’s way into the audio recording.    Believe me, this is not the end of many problems for diarization!  Maybe in a conference call with multiple speakers, even if the audio is clear, the difference can be very subtle between the speakers, and it is not always possible to identify/label the correct speaker for a particular timestamp/duration. Ok, so that’s it? If I have not made my point clear about the complexity of the problem, yet, then I’ll express my message through this legendary meme.   Fig 2. : Diarization is hard!More Problems?    All the problems stated above are considering that preprocessing steps like VAD/SAD worked perfectly, which you may have guessed, are obviously not 100% accurate.   What is this “preprocessing step”?   Voice Activity Detection (VAD) or Speech Activity Detection (SAD) is a widely used audio preprocessing technique, before running a typical diariaztion api based on the clustering of speaker embeddings. The objective of VAD/SAD is to get rid of all non-speech regions.  Approaching the problemKeeping in mind the complexity and hardness of the problem, multiple approaches have been devised over the years to tackle diarization. Some earlier approaches were based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)/ Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). More recently, Neural Embedding (x-vectors/d-vectors) + Clustering and End2End Neural methods have demonstrated their power. As stated in this paper by Fujita et al. , a x-vector/d-vector clustering-based system is commonly used for speaker diarization and most of our experiments are based around this approach.   Fig 3. : The image shows the cluster generated based on the speech pattern and precise time the speaker participated in the conversation. The aim of speaker clustering is to put together all the segments that belong to the same acoustic source in a recording. These don’t utilize any prior information of the speaker ID or the number of speakers in the recording. We’ll be covering a typical embedding-clustering based approach in detail in the latter sections of the blog. However, speaker diarization systems which combine the two tasks in a unified framework are gaining popularity in recent times. Fig 4 visually summarizes the End2End idea. Due to the increased amounts of data being avaialable, joint End2End modeling methods are slowly taking over older approaches across ML domains, alleviating the complex preparation processes involved earlier. One example is EEND: End2End Neural Diarization by Fujita et al. proposed recently showing some promise in regards to solving these complex steps jointly.   Fig 4. : An End to End approach diarization system. Defining Our Problem: We need to answer the question “What should be a robust diarization system?” before moving forward. We decided to try out multiple approaches and model experiments explained in the sections below. Our model should be powerful enough to capture global speaker characteristics in addition to local speech activity dynamics. A systems, that is able to accurately handle highly interactive and overlapping speech specifically in the telephony call audios conversational domain, while being resilient to variation in mobile microphones, recording environment, reverberation, ambient noise, speaker demographics. Since we have a more focused problem, for evaluating customer care center call audios, the number of speakers for our use case is fixed at two i. e “AGENT” and “CUSTOMER” for each call, we need to tune our model for the same. Method:   Fig 5. : A typical diarization pipeline.    VAD — We employ WebRTC VAD to remove noise and non speech regions during our experiments. Raw audios are split into frames with specific duration (30 ms in our case). For each input frame, WebRTC generates output 1 or 0, where 1 denotes speech and 0 denotes nonspeech. An optional setting of WebRTC is the aggressive mode, an integer between 0 and 3. 0 is the least aggressive about filtering out nonspeech while 3 is the most aggressive. These VAD/SAD models have their own respective struggles with and set of problems.     Embedder — Resemblyzer allows you to derive a high-level representation of a voice through a deep learning model (referred to as the voice encoder). Given an audio file of speech, it creates a summary vector of size 256 (embedding) that summarizes the characteristics of the voice spoken.     Clustering — We cluster the segment wise embedding using a simple K-Means to produce diarization results and determine the number of speakers with each speakers time stamps.     Resegmentation - Finally, an optional supervised classification step may be applied to actually identity every speaker cluster in a supervised way.  Evaluation Metrics: To evaluate the performance or to estimate the influence of errors on thecomplete pipeline, we use the standard metrics implemented inpyannote-metrics. We also need to account for the fact that these time-stamps are manuallyannotated by data-annotators and hence cannot be precise at the audio samplelevel. It is a common practice in speaker diarization research to remove afixed collar around each speaker turn boundary from being evaluated using ourmetric of choice. A 0. 4sec collar would exclude 200ms before and after theboundary. Diarization error rate (DER) is the de facto standard metric for evaluating and comparing speaker diarization systems. It is measured as the fraction of time that is not attributed correctly to a speaker or non-speech. The DER is composed of the following three errors: False Alarm: It is the percentage of scored time that a hypothesized speaker is labelled as a non-speech in the reference. The false alarm error occurs mainly due to the the speech/non-speech detection error (i. e. , the speech/non-speech detection considers a non-speech segment as a speech segment). Hence, false alarm error is not related to segmentation and clustering errors. Missed Detection: It is the percentage of scored time that a hypothesized non-speech segment corresponds to a reference speaker segment. The missed speech occurs mainly due to the the speech/non-speech detection error (i. e. , the speech segment is considered as a non-speech segment). Hence, missed speech is not related to segmentation and clustering errors. Confusion: It is the percentage of scored time that a speaker ID is assigned to the wrong speaker. Confusion error is mainly a diarization system error (i. e. , it is not related to speech/non-speech detection. ) It also does not take into account the overlap speeches not detected. [\text{DER} = \frac{\text{false alarm} + \text{missed detection} + \text{confusion}}{\text{total}}] Resegmentation: As stated earlier, speaker diarization consists of automatically partitioning an input audio stream into homogeneous segments (segmentation) and assigning these segments to the same speaker (speaker clustering). Read more about segmentation here. Is it possible to resegment these assignments, post clustering, to achieve an improved lower DER? This is exactly the job of a resegmentation module. Simply put, we had a condition to be improved, a difficulty to be eliminated, and a troubling question that existed.  If yes, in what scenarios this optional (Resegmentation) module helps? Before going ahead with resegmentation, we needed meaningful understanding and deliberate investigation of the predictions to answer the above question. We brainstormed on this particular section involving post-processing of predictions in the diarization pipeline. After analysis and comparisons of predicted annotations made to the true annotations, our system, though good (with DER=0. 05), was possibly facing an issue. We were hit by something called oversegmentation, which can be seen in figure 6 below.   Fig 6. : Oversegmentation. Need for resegmentation?To fix this problem and in the process making our system more robust, we tried multiple experiments tweaking the resegmentation module.  Standard Smoothing: This is a simple annotation post processing smoothing function to solve the abrupt annotated segments (oversegmented regions) by merging these items smaller than or equal to the threshold (duration less than 0. 2 seconds) with neighbouring annotation. We instantly got a 1% boost in DER (0. 04) after smoothing. Our initial hunch about oversegmentation based on the analysis was now supported by results from this simple exercise. This made us think about a few more questions:  Can we do even better? Can we use the labels and supervise the resegmentation module learning this smoothing function at the very least? Are there some other errors in the predictions which we may have overlooked, but probably a learned resegmentation model captures? Can we leverage clustering confidences to improve the resegmentation module?Aiming to answer the above questions, we came up with a Supervised Resegmentation Sequence2Sequence model.    Supervised Seq2Seq Resegmentation: The goal of the model as shown below is to learn a mapping from the initial predictions to the ground truth sequence based on supervised training.    Resegmentation Goal       PREDICTIONS             GROUND TRUTH [A, A, A, A, B, A, A, B, B, B . . . . ] -&gt; [A, A, A, A, A, A, A, B, B, B . . . . ] where A : Speaker 1    B : Speaker 2    each label represents fixed duration of 400ms in our annotations.     To achieve such a mapping we worked on a simple Seq2Seq LSTM based model. We also enriched this model with information of cluster confidences after tweaking our Embedding+Clustering pipeline to do a soft clustering, i. e. return cluster scores based on the distance of each point in the cluster from the centroid along with the clustered predictions.  Overall all the above steps regarding a supervised resegmentation model were completely experimental and based on a few ideas. We are yet to achieve convincing results based on this approach but I thought it would be nice to mention this cool experiment :). Providing more resegmentation sequences for training could definitely and we also try to tackle diarization with limited data. See here UIS-RNN: To explore more supervised methods, we also experimented with Fully Supervised Speaker Diarization or the UIS-RNN model, the current state of the art neural system for Speaker Diarization. Converting data to UIS Style format involves a set of preprocessing steps similar to what we had to for our supervised resegmentation model. More on the official UIS-RNN Repo. But a caveat with UIS-RNN is that it requires huge amounts of data to form a convincing hypothesis after training. On realizing the limited amount of tagged data we had, we worked on simulating datasets for Speaker Diarization which in itself comes with some challenges. Simulated Data Generation:   Fig 7. : Diarization Data SimulationWe started with a large number of dual channel audio calls as a requirement for generating this Speaker Diarization Dataset. These dual channel audios were then split and saved into mono channel audio files. The key idea is that each mono channel contains one speaker and if we are able to combine these mono channeled audios compunded with known timestamps of speakers, we can then possibly recreate the audios which are potentially useful for Supervised Speaker Diarization. Steps as shown in Fig 7:    Split dual channel audio calls into mono channel audios.   Running Webrtc VAD on the mono channels:     Aggressive : Speech Regions.    Mild : Invert to get Gap Regions    Compute statistics in real audios: This step is required for us to understand the dynamics of overlaps and silences in a call on avergae. We compute the following ratios:     \[\text{Silence Ratio} = \frac{\text{Duration of Silences}}{\text{Total Duration}}\]      \[\text{Overlap Ratio} = \frac{\text{Duration of Overlapping Utterances}}{\text{Total Duration}}\]       Combination of Speech from A and B with timestamps. At the same time we needed to add real Gaps/Silence fills and Overlaps (interrupts and overtalking) to mimic real world call audios which are highly interactive. To control the amount of overlap in data-generation, we used 2 parameters mainly.      scale_overlap : This allowed us to control the maximum possible duration of overlap and was set based on the stats gathered in step 3.    bias_overlap : This allowed us to control the percentage or probability if there is an overlapping segment. Eg: setting bias_overlap to 0. 75 will give 33% chance each time to add overlap.     Dump tagged speaker timestamps and simulated audios. That’s all for now, and we’ll end this blog here.

    "body": "2020/02/05 - Vernacular. ai processes millions of speech recognition requests every day, and to handle such a load we have focused on building a highly scalable technical stack. Firstly, we realized the drawbacks of using HTTP/1. 1 keeping in mind one of our requirements to do end to end streaming recognition to reduce the overall latency of the system. So, we decided to migrate all our core services from REST APIs (HTTP/1. 1 + JSON) to gRPC (HTTP/2. 0 + Protobuf). In this article, I will take you through the benefits and challenges of adopting gRPC when compared to a REST-based communication style. What is Microservices Architecture?:  Defines an architecture that structures the application as a set of loosely coupled, collaborating services. Services communicate using either synchronous protocols such as HTTP/REST, gRPC or asynchronous protocols such as AMQP. Services can be developed and deployed independently of one another. What are the challenges of adopting Microservices Architecture?: While there are many strong benefits of moving to a microservices architecture — there are no silver bullets! This means there are tradeoffs to make! Microservices gives us a higher level of complexity, and there are several inherent challenges with microservices you need to take into account when changing from a monolithic architecture. Like,  Inter-service network communication Data serialization/de-serialization Security/Authentication Language Interoperability Streaming Data Monitoring DebugginggRPC gives us the tools and capabilities to combat these issues without having to roll your custom frameworks. What is gRPC?:  gRPC is a modern open-source high-performance RPC framework that can run in any environment. It can efficiently connect services in and across data centres with pluggable support for load balancing, tracing, health checking and authentication. It is also applicable in the last mile of distributed computing to connect devices, mobile applications and browsers to backend services. What are Protocol buffers?:  Protocol Buffers, another open-source project by Google, is a language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for quickly serializing structured data in a small binary packet. By default, gRPC used Protocol Buffers v3 for data serialisation. When working with Protocol Buffers, we write a . proto file to define the data structures that we will be using in our RPC calls. This also tells protobuf how to serialise this data when sending it over the wire. This results in small data packets being sent over the network, which keeps your RPC calls fast, as there are fewer data to transmit. It also makes your code execute faster, as it spends less time serializing and deserializing the data that is being transmitted. Here you can see, we are defining a Person data structure, with a name, an id and multiple phone numbers of different types. syntax =  proto3 ;message Person {string name = 1;  int32 id = 2;  string email = 3;  enum PhoneType {   MOBILE = 0;   HOME = 1;   WORK = 2;  }  message PhoneNumber {   string number = 1;   PhoneType type = 2;  }  repeated PhoneNumber phone = 4;}Along with the data structures, we can also define RPC functions in the services section of our . proto file. There are several types of RPC calls available — as we can see in GetFeature, we can do the standard synchronous request/response model, but we can also more advanced types of RPC calls, such as with RouteChat, where we can send information via bi-directional streams in a completely asynchronous way. From these . proto files, we can use the gRPC tooling to generate both clients and server-side code that handles all the technical details of the RPC invocation, data serialisation, transmission and error handling. This means we can focus on the logic of our application rather than worry about these implementation details. service RouteGuide { rpc GetFeature(Point) returns (Feature); rpc RouteChat(stream RouteNote) returns (stream RouteNote);}message Point { int32 Latitude = 1; int32 Longitude = 2;}message Feature { string name = 1; Point location = 2;}message RouteNote { Point location = 1; string message = 2;}gRPC (HTTP/2. 0 + Protobuf) vs REST (HTTP/1. 1 + JSON): HTTP/1. x HTTP/0. 9 was a one-line protocol to bootstrap the World Wide Web HTTP/1. 0 documented the popular extensions to HTTP/0. 9 in an informational standard. HTTP/1. 1 introduced an official IETF standard. HTTP/1. x clients need to use multiple connections to achieve concurrency and reduce latency; HTTP/1. x does not compress request and response headers, causing unnecessary network traffic; HTTP/1. x does not allow effective resource prioritization, resulting in poor use of the underlying TCP connection; and so on. Advantages of HTTP/2. 0 The first advantage HTTP/2 gives you over HTTP/1. x is speed.  HTTP/2 reduces latency by enabling full request and response multiplexing, minimize protocol overhead via efficient compression of HTTP header fields, support for request prioritization, allows multiple concurrent exchanges on the same connection and server push.   HTTP/2 vs HTTP/1. 1 Multiplexing — HTTP/1. 1 vs HTTP/2. 0 HTTP/2 gives us multiplexing. Therefore, multiple gRPC calls can communicate over a single TCP/IP connection without the overhead of disconnecting and reconnecting over and over again as HTTP/1. 1 will do for each request. This removes a huge overhead from traditional HTTP forms of communication.   Bi-directional Streaming HTTP/2 also has bi-directional streaming built-in. This means gRPC can send asynchronous, non-blocking data up and down, such as the RPC example we saw earlier, without having to resort to much slower techniques like HTTP-long polling. A gRPC client can send data to the server and the gRPC server can send data to the client in a completely asynchronous manner. This means that doing real-time, streaming communication over a microservices architecture is exceptionally easy to implement in our applications Multi-language support One of the big advantages of microservices architecture is using different languages for different services. gRPC works across multiple languages and platforms. Currently, these languages/frameworks are supported,  Go Ruby PHP Java / Android C++ C# Objective-C / iOS Python Node. js DartThe best part is that gRPC is not just a library, but tooling as well. Once you have your . proto file defined, you can generate client and server stubs for all of these languages, allowing your RPC services to use a single API no matter what language they are written in! This means that you can choose the right tool for the job when building your microservices — you aren’t locked into just one language or platform. gRPC will generate clients and servers stubs that are canonically written for the language you want to use, and also take care of the serialisation and deserialisation of data in a way that your language of choice will understand! There’s no need to worry about transport protocols or how data should be sent over the wire. All this is simply handled for you, and you can focus instead on the logic of your services as you write them.

All this is simply handled for you, and you can focus instead on the logic of your services as you write them. What are the challenges in adopting gRPC?: Load Balancing Our microservices are containerized and deployed using Kubernetes, an open-source container orchestration system. Kubernetes’s default load balancing often doesn’t work out of the box with gRPC, we use Linkerd (Service Mesh) for gRPC load balancing with sidecar container injected to existing pods. More about gRPC load balancing with Kubernetes and other gRPC load balancing options Manual Testing Since gRPC is a binary protocol, the RPC methods cannot be manually tested using GUI tools like Postman (generally used for HTTP/1. 1 text-based protocol). We have used Evans REPL for gRPC introspection and manual testing. To conclude, I would highly recommend everyone to try out gRPC and start migrating to gRPC in production.

    "title": "A REPL for Conversations",
    "body": "2020/01/30 - A REPL, in programming, is an interactive environment where a programmercan go through the cycle of writing code, getting it Read,Evaluated, output Printed and then back in a Loop. Fundamentally,a REPL merges usage and extension of a system in a single interface. This merger has been important in providing easy extensibility to theend programmers in many programming languages. Interaction is supervisionWe can envision a similar merger in human intelligence involvinglanguages. After getting to a certain level of language understanding,our interactive behavior can be manipulated itself by interactions. Interactions cover all possible dialogs. Manipulative interactions orsupervision, as we like to call it, cover whatever is involved inupdating the state of the internal model which, in turn, affects thebehavior. Most of the machine dialog platforms aren't designed to expose thisequivalence explicitly. We have a different language for providingsupervision and different for building the interaction experiences andthat's it. Consider the chatbots you see on various websites thesedays. These have an interaction language which is a natural language,and a separate supervision language which stays at the programmer'sbeck in the background. I can't improve my personal interaction withthe system or extend it's behavior by talking to it. I can do that witha human agent easily. We definitely are moving towards such systems by adding control knobspiece by piece. But still aren't looking very actively for a generalframework of user initiated supervision. Practically this is not goingto be immediately helpful for many reasons known to all of us working inthe field, but it's helpful to define various kinds of platforms formachine dialog involving users on a continuum who all program theirdesired changes using their own interactive languages. From the technical side, of course there are problems that need to besolved for this. Since natural languages are already there, as comparedto a language to be designed, this needs a lot of work inunderstanding and creating computational models of languageacquisition fromone end and works in zero and few shot learnings from the other. Sublanguages are still going to be the more efficient way for working ata certain level, just like mathematical notations are for talking aboutmathematics, but we can target a natural language REPL layer on top ofcurrent dialog platforms and aim for a sort of interactive malleabilityfor growing the system organically afterwards. Growing a conversational agentThis malleability is not only a learning but also design problem at themoment1. A problem similar to designing a programming language. Whatwe want the language user to accomplish is our focus right now. How wecan let the language itself grow is a problem we will be designingsystems for in the future. Once this interaction language is capableenough, we can have an ecosystem of extensions and libraries making aminimal system malleable enough to allow building drastically differentexperiences on top of it. And it’s important that the system accepts growth at various levels if it has togeneralize across many use cases. In his talk ‘Growing a Language’, Guy L. Steele cites lack of this growth as the difference between APL and Lisp. In APL“there was no way for a user to grow the language in a smooth way”. Thesmoothness here focuses on extensibility in terms of language primitives. Fromthe same talk:  If I want to help other persons to write all sorts of programs, shouldI design a small programming language or a large one?  I stand on this claim: I should not design a small language, and Ishould not design a large one. I need to design a language that cangrow. I need to plan ways in which it might grow—but I need, too, toleave some choices so that other persons can make those choices at alater time. Conversational systems are interesting from many more angles than justwhat their components look like at the moment, which includes Speech ToText, Language Understanding, Dialog Management, Text To Speech, etc. Improving metrics under the current framework is a decent and importantgoal, but there are many interesting challenges in the design aspects ofhow we build and let others build conversational experiences themselves.       Many researches in self learning systems are orthogonal here asyou can have low generalization and still make a natural languageREPL.  &#8617;    "
