# Google Summer of Code - 2022

This page contains ideas which we'd like to get help from GSoC Contributors. But before all that, if you haven't heard about Skit.


## What is Skit?

We are a series B funded, AI-first SaaS voice automation company specializing in delivering multilingual voice bots for contact center automation. We have our Speech Bots deployed in major banks and large enterprises in several verticals. We have a foothold in India and are expanding in the US and South-East Asia.

We have been listed in [Forbes 30 Under 30 Asia 2021](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkang/2021/04/19/the-forbes-30-under-30-asia-startups-unshackling-businesses-using-ai/?sh=9268fa85f9aa) and have been named by Gartner as a [Cool vendor in Conversational and NLT Widen Use Cases](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211221005315/en/Skit-Named-as-a-Cool-Vendor-in-Gartner-Cool-Vendors-in-Conversational-and-NLT-Widen-Use-Cases-Domain-Knowledge-and-Dialect-Support?utm_medium=email&_hsmi=202791220&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--yQEAO9Q810nr71J9I8MPppXkOWpWg51LqIrOdv_Wc2X_Hj-ydmia5ruRLbQEEat7EPQ6fn_GHMMVWu4tUV8beoU2BQA&utm_content=202791220&utm_source=hs_email).

Our goal is to build the most natural and robust multi lingual voice bot with state of the art human-machine interaction capabilities.

We build voicebots, so that agents don't have to sit and answer user queries 24/7 for 365 days.

## GSoC 2022 Ideas

1. Enhancements to dialogy via core code or plugins.

### Project Description
[Dialogy](https://skit-ai.github.io/dialogy/) is a framework to build machine-learning solutions for speech applications speech dialogue systems. 

The main principles which form the backbone of dialogy are:

* Plugin-based: Makes it easy to import/export components to projects.
* Stack-agnostic: No assumptions made on ML stack; your choice of machine learning library will not be affected by using Dialogy.
* Progressive: Minimal boilerplate writing to let you focus on your machine learning problems.

At current shape, dialogy allows one to train models, test performance on metrics and deploy applications. We want to add more features which are desirable in an complete SLU framework. These features could include

* Hyperparameter Tuning
* Model interpretability via Captum, LIT integration
* Integration with experiment tracking platforms

### GitHub Link(s): 
* [dialogy](https://github.com/skit-ai/dialogy)
* [dialogy-template-simple-transformers](https://github.com/skit-ai/dialogy-template-simple-transformers)

### Expected Outcomes

Dialogy as a platform would have following features after the project
* Integrated with experiment tracking for better project management
* Integrated with model explainability and interpretability frameworks allowing users to use these tools
* Integrated with an hyperparameter tuning service/library


### Skills Required
Understanding of Machine Learning frameworks like PyTorch, Huggingface, etc.
And of course Python.
