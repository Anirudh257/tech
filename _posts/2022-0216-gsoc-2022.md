# Google Summer of Code - 2022

This page contains ideas which we'd like to get help from GSoC Contributors. But before all that, if you haven't heard about Skit.


## What is Skit?

Skit is a startup based out of Bangalore, IN (but an international one since, we are operating in the USA and Indonesia as well) solving speech related problems highly specific to call centers.

We build voicebots, so that agents don't have to sit and answer user queries 24/7 for 365 days.
Yes, we do call center automation.

You can get to know more about us over [here](https://skit.ai/)

Our tech blog is present [here](https://tech.skit.ai/)


## GSoC 2022 Ideas

1. Enhancements to dialogy via core code or plugins.

### Project Description
[Dialogy](https://skit-ai.github.io/dialogy/) is a framework to build machine-learning solutions for speech applications speech dialogue systems. 

The main principles which form the backbone of dialogy are:

* Plugin-based: Makes it easy to import/export components to projects.
* Stack-agnostic: No assumptions made on ML stack; your choice of machine learning library will not be affected by using Dialogy.
* Progressive: Minimal boilerplate writing to let you focus on your machine learning problems.

At current shape, dialogy allows one to train models, test performance on metrics and deploy applications. We want to add more features which are desirable in an complete SLU framework. These features could include

* Hyperparameter Tuning
* Model interpretability via Captum, LIT integration
* Integration with experiment tracking platforms

### GitHub Link(s): 
[dialogy](https://github.com/skit-ai/dialogy)
[dialogy-template-simple-transformers](https://github.com/skit-ai/dialogy-template-simple-transformers)

### Expected Outcomes

Dialogy as a platform would have following features after the project
* Integrated with experiment tracking for better project management
* Integrated with model explainability and interpretability frameworks allowing users to use these tools
* Integrated with an hyperparameter tuning service/library


### Skills Required
Understanding of Machine Learning frameworks like PyTorch, Huggingface, etc.
And of course Python.
